# LwIP NAT ROUTER with user interface

This is modified NAT ROUTER made by Martin-Ger https://github.com/martin-ger/lwip_nat_arduino <br>
<br>
Make sure you will follow his tutorial how to set it up and then you can use my modified ".ino" files.<br>
If you get an Exception(9) then first upload "EEPROM-ZERO.ino" and then NAT ROUTER file.<br><br>
I also have had problems uploading this sketch to ESP01 and ESP07 but it works fine with ESP12.

# What it will have?
It has user interface at IP 192.168.4.1 where you can insert your router information and also AP information. You also can change your device IP address inside sketch.
