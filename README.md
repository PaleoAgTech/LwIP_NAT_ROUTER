# LwIP NAT ROUTER

This is modified NAT ROUTER made by Martin-Ger https://github.com/martin-ger/lwip_nat_arduino <br>
<br>
Make sure you will follow his tutorial how to set it up and then you can use my modified ".ino" files.<br>
If you get an Exception(9) then first upload "EEPROM-ZERO.ino" and then NAT ROUTER file.<br><br>
I also have had problems uploading this sketch to ESP01 and ESP07 but it works fine with ESP12.
